# UFOs

## Overview of Project
In this project, we helped a Data Journalist work on a story regarding UFO sightings. Using a JavaScript file with UFO sighting data, we were able to build a dynamic webpage.

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
