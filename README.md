# UFOs

## Overview of Project
In this project, we helped a Data Journalist work on a story regarding UFO sightings. Utilizing a file containing UFO sighting data, we were able to build a dynamic webpage using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. 

Webpage users are able to filter the table by date, city, state, country and shape. 

### Shape Filter

## Summary

One drawback that I noticed it that the comments that are too long get cut off mid-sentence. It would be helpful to have an option to expand the row by clicking on it or hovering over it. Another drawback is that the filter fields are case sensitive, so for instance searching by the state "ca" will return several results, but searching for "CA" will not return any. I would recommend removing the case-sensitivity in order to make the webpage more user friendly. The data file only included UFO sightings from 2010, so I would recommend using data from additional years in order to look for any trends or anomalies.
